Week of October 10th

I most of the drudgework done on the server, setting it up to connect to the
database and handle requests from the client. I also started working on
implementing the different methods, but only a few of them are currently
functional. The user requests (GetUserDetails and UpdateUserDetails) are
complete, I just need to add some error handling, and the creator requests
(UploadMap and UploadEvent) are taking shape.
