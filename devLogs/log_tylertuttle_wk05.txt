Week of October 17th

I finished the work on getting the server to handle the different requests that
the user would send from the app, implementing the remaining methods. Now all 8
of the methods are completely functional, although I still need to go in and
make sure Iâ€™m checking for errors and test everything to make sure it works
without any bugs.
