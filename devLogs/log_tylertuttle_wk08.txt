Week of November 7th

I spent most of the week trying to fix an issue with sending certain requests.
For example, the GetMapDetails method should return a Map object, but since the
requests in Volley are asynchronous you need to do them in a slightly different
way. To send synchronous requests, you must create a new thread and use a
Future, which is an object that represents the result of an asynchronous method
call. I spent most of the week trying to figure out how to do that in a nice
manner, but in the end, I decided to change the way you call these methods: a
ResponseListener is provided by the activity that calls the method, allowing
all the requests to be asynchronous while still making sure that the user
cannot continue before important information is sent to/from the server.
