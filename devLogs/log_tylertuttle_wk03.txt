Week of October 3rd

This week I spent most of my time figuring out how the server and database
would be designed. I figured out the different types of requests that the app
would send to the server, and decided how best to handle them and how to store
the data in the database. In the end, there are 8 different types of requests
and the database has 5 tables: users, maps, events, markers, and options. 

I decided to use node.js for the server and SQLite for the database since that
is what I’m familiar with, having used both technologies before. The server is
a simple one, so learning an entirely new technology wouldn’t be a very good
investment of my time.
