Week of November 14th: Deliverable 2

This week we had to present our demo. In the demo, the maps/events were
hard-coded in so most of my code was not on display this week. We did go over
how the server would function and what data would be sent back and forth
however.

I finished changing the way that synchronous requests are handled. Now, the
activity that wants to send the request will provide a listener object that
will return whatever the response is supposed to be (for example getUserDetails
takes a ResonseListener<User> object as a parameter). This way, the activity
can handle how it deals with having to wait for a response from the server as
well as making it simpler to implement. With that out of the way, I can move on
to implementing the various methods that will make specific requests to the
server.
