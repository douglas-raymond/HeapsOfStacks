Week of October 31st

This week I cleaned up the server code, handling any errors as well as removing
any test variables or functions I had created. As of right now the server is
pretty much 100% complete, at least for the purposes of the project. All the
functionality that we need is done and tested.

I began implementing the request code on the client side, using an API called
Volley from the Android Open Source Project. The way I have it set up is to
wrap the code for sending requests and handling responses with Volley in a
singleton class, and have methods in that class that expose the various API
calls to the server.
