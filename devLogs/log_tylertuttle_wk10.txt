Week of November 21st

Once I had the new way of sending requests in place, I could finish the actual
methods that would communicate with the User object. This involved either
creating a JSON object and sending it to the server or parsing a JSON string
that was sent from the server and returning the object to the User class. I had
to do this separately for each of the 8 methods that I defined on the server.
